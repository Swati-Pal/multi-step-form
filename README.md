📝 Multistep Form Project This project was created as a part of the Frontend Mentor challenges to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The multistep form allows users to input their personal and payment details in a step-by-step process.

🚀 Getting Started To get started with the project, clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser.

🎨 Design The project's design was provided by Frontend Mentor, and I implemented it using HTML and CSS. The form is responsive and looks great on all devices.

🔧 Functionality The form is created using JavaScript and allows users to move between steps while validating their input. The form also includes a progress bar that updates as users move through the steps.

📝 Learnings I learned a lot about building responsive forms, form validation, and DOM manipulation while working on this project. It was a great learning experience for beginners like me.

🎉 Conclusion Creating this multistep form was challenging, but it was also a lot of fun. I hope this project will help other beginners like me to learn and grow their skills in front-end development.
